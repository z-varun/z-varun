## Professional Summary

With over 8 years of hands-on experience in DevSecOps, Site Reliability Engineering, and Cloud Security, I've dedicated my career to transforming security from a compliance checkbox into a strategic enabler for business innovation.

My journey began in traditional DevOps and SRE roles, where I quickly recognized that security couldn't be an afterthought. This realization drove me to specialize in building security-first architectures that don't just protect systems—they empower teams to move faster with confidence.

## Security as an Enabler, Not a Blocker

I believe that security should accelerate, not impede, development velocity. My approach centers on:

- **Shifting Security Left**: Integrating security controls directly into CI/CD pipelines, making secure coding the path of least resistance
- **Automation First**: Reducing manual security reviews through intelligent automation, policy-as-code, and continuous compliance monitoring
- **Developer Empowerment**: Creating Security Champions programs that embed security expertise within engineering teams
- **Measured Risk**: Balancing security rigor with business pragmatism through quantitative risk assessment

## Focus Areas & Achievements

### CI/CD Pipeline Security
Designed and implemented comprehensive security gates across multi-cloud CI/CD pipelines, integrating SAST, DAST, SCA, container scanning, and artifact signing. Reduced production vulnerabilities by 75% while maintaining deployment velocity.

### Vulnerability Management Programs
Established enterprise-wide vulnerability management frameworks that prioritize remediation based on exploitability, business impact, and threat intelligence—not just CVSS scores.

### Cloud Security Architecture
Architected secure-by-default landing zones for AWS, Azure, and GCP, implementing guardrails through Service Control Policies, Azure Policy, and GCP Organization Policies. Designed infrastructure-as-code patterns that enforce security best practices.

### Kubernetes Security Hardening
Led initiatives to harden Kubernetes clusters through network policies, Pod Security Standards, admission controllers (OPA Gatekeeper), runtime security monitoring, and secure supply chain practices.

### Threat Modeling & Security Reviews
Conducted architecture security reviews and threat modeling sessions for mission-critical systems, identifying high-risk vulnerabilities pre-production and reducing incident response costs.

### Observability & Security Monitoring
Built comprehensive security observability platforms integrating SIEM, threat detection, anomaly detection, and automated incident response workflows.

## Technical Expertise

**Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Azure, GCP  
**Container & Orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes, ECS, AKS, GKE  
**Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi, Ansible  
**CI/CD Tools**: Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps  
**Security Tools**: Snyk, SonarQube, Trivy, Falco, OPA, Vault, Checkov  
**Programming**: Python, Go, Bash, PowerShell  
**Monitoring & Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Datadog, Splunk  

## Beyond Work

When I'm not securing cloud infrastructure, you'll find me:

- Contributing to open-source security projects
- Participating in CTF competitions and security research
- Writing technical blog posts to share knowledge with the community
- Mentoring aspiring security engineers and developers
- Exploring algorithmic challenges and competitive programming

## Philosophy

**"Security is not a product, but a process."** — Bruce Schneier

This quote resonates deeply with my approach. True security emerges from continuous improvement, automation, collaboration, and a culture where everyone takes ownership of security outcomes.
