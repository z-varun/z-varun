## Introduction

Kubernetes provides powerful orchestration capabilities, but with great power comes great responsibility. Without proper guardrails, developers can inadvertently deploy insecure configurations—containers running as root, missing resource limits, or exposed sensitive ports.

**Open Policy Agent (OPA)** is a general-purpose policy engine that enables you to enforce security and compliance policies across your cloud-native stack. In this post, we'll explore how OPA works, why it's essential for Kubernetes security, and walk through a practical example of enforcing resource limits using **Rego**, OPA's declarative policy language.

---

## What is Open Policy Agent (OPA)?

Open Policy Agent is an open-source, graduated CNCF project that decouples **policy decision-making** from policy enforcement. OPA provides a unified framework for defining and evaluating policies across different systems—Kubernetes, Terraform, microservices, CI/CD pipelines, and more.

### Key Concepts

- **Policy**: A set of rules written in Rego that define what is allowed or denied
- **Query**: A request sent to OPA to evaluate whether an action complies with a policy
- **Decision**: OPA's response indicating whether the action is permitted, denied, or requires modification

### Why OPA for Kubernetes?

Kubernetes admission controllers intercept API requests before resources are created. OPA integrates with Kubernetes as a **validating admission webhook**, allowing you to:

- **Reject** non-compliant deployments before they reach the cluster
- **Mutate** resources to apply default security settings automatically
- **Audit** existing resources for policy violations

---

## OPA vs. Other Policy Engines

| Feature | OPA | Kyverno | PodSecurityPolicy (Deprecated) |
|---------|-----|---------|-------------------------------|
| **Language** | Rego (declarative) | YAML-based policies | YAML-based |
| **Scope** | Multi-system (K8s, Terraform, etc.) | Kubernetes-specific | Kubernetes-specific |
| **Mutation Support** | Yes (via Gatekeeper) | Yes | No |
| **Learning Curve** | Moderate | Low | Low |
| **Community** | Large (CNCF Graduated) | Growing | Deprecated in K8s 1.25 |

While Kyverno offers an easier learning curve for Kubernetes-only use cases, OPA's flexibility makes it ideal for organizations standardizing policy enforcement across multiple platforms.

## Architecture: OPA Gatekeeper in Kubernetes

**OPA Gatekeeper** is a Kubernetes-native integration of OPA that simplifies policy management using Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).

### Key Components

1. **ConstraintTemplates**: Define reusable policy logic in Rego
2. **Constraints**: Instantiate a ConstraintTemplate with specific parameters
3. **Config**: Defines which Kubernetes resources to sync to OPA's cache

### How It Works




When a user attempts to create a Deployment, the API server forwards the request to Gatekeeper, which evaluates it against all active Constraints. If the resource violates a policy, the request is rejected with a detailed error message.

---

## Installing OPA Gatekeeper

### Prerequisites

- A running Kubernetes cluster (v1.16+)
- `kubectl` configured to access the cluster

### Installation

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/release-3.14/deploy/gatekeeper.yaml

text

Verify installation:

kubectl get pods -n gatekeeper-system

text

You should see pods like `gatekeeper-controller-manager` running.

---

## Writing Your First Rego Policy

Let's create a policy that ensures all Kubernetes Deployments have **CPU and memory resource limits** defined. This prevents resource exhaustion and improves cluster stability.

### Step 1: Create a ConstraintTemplate

The `ConstraintTemplate` defines the Rego logic.

apiVersion: templates.gatekeeper.sh/v1
kind: ConstraintTemplate
metadata:
name: k8srequiredresourcelimits
annotations:
description: "Requires containers to have CPU and memory limits defined"
spec:
crd:
spec:
names:
kind: K8sRequiredResourceLimits
validation:
openAPIV3Schema:
type: object
properties:
exemptImages:
type: array
items:
type: string
targets:
- target: admission.k8s.gatekeeper.sh
rego: |
package k8srequiredresourcelimits

text
    # Violation occurs if any container lacks resource limits
    violation[{"msg": msg}] {
      container := input.review.object.spec.template.spec.containers[_]
      not container.resources.limits.cpu
      msg := sprintf("Container '%s' must define CPU limits", [container.name])
    }

    violation[{"msg": msg}] {
      container := input.review.object.spec.template.spec.containers[_]
      not container.resources.limits.memory
      msg := sprintf("Container '%s' must define memory limits", [container.name])
    }

    # Allow exemptions for specific images (e.g., monitoring agents)
    violation[{"msg": msg}] {
      container := input.review.object.spec.template.spec.containers[_]
      not exempt_image(container.image)
      not container.resources.limits
      msg := sprintf("Container '%s' must define resource limits", [container.name])
    }

    exempt_image(image) {
      exempt := input.parameters.exemptImages[_]
      startswith(image, exempt)
    }
text

### Rego Explanation

- **`violation[{"msg": msg}]`**: Defines a rule that produces a violation message if the condition is met
- **`input.review.object`**: Contains the Kubernetes resource being evaluated
- **`container := input.review.object.spec.template.spec.containers[_]`**: Iterates over all containers in the Deployment
- **`not container.resources.limits.cpu`**: Checks if CPU limits are missing
- **`exempt_image(image)`**: Allows certain images (e.g., Prometheus exporters) to bypass the policy

### Step 2: Apply the ConstraintTemplate

kubectl apply -f constraint-template.yaml

text

### Step 3: Create a Constraint

The `Constraint` instantiates the ConstraintTemplate and defines enforcement scope.

apiVersion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: K8sRequiredResourceLimits
metadata:
name: require-deployment-limits
spec:
match:
kinds:
- apiGroups: ["apps"]
kinds: ["Deployment"]
namespaces:
- "production"
- "staging"
parameters:
exemptImages:
- "prometheus/node-exporter"
- "fluent/fluent-bit"

text

This constraint:

- Applies only to **Deployments** in `production` and `staging` namespaces
- Exempts monitoring containers from the policy

kubectl apply -f constraint.yaml

text

---

## Testing the Policy

### Deploying a Non-Compliant Resource

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
name: bad-deployment
namespace: production
spec:
replicas: 2
selector:
matchLabels:
app: myapp
template:
metadata:
labels:
app: myapp
spec:
containers:
- name: web
image: nginx:latest
# Missing resources.limits

text

Attempting to deploy this will result in:

kubectl apply -f bad-deployment.yaml

Error from server ([require-deployment-limits] Container 'web' must define CPU limits
[require-deployment-limits] Container 'web' must define memory limits):
error when creating "bad-deployment.yaml": admission webhook "validation.gatekeeper.sh" denied the request

text

### Deploying a Compliant Resource

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
name: good-deployment
namespace: production
spec:
replicas: 2
selector:
matchLabels:
app: myapp
template:
metadata:
labels:
app: myapp
spec:
containers:
- name: web
image: nginx:latest
resources:
limits:
cpu: "500m"
memory: "512Mi"
requests:
cpu: "250m"
memory: "256Mi"

text

This deployment succeeds because resource limits are defined.

---

## Auditing Existing Resources

Gatekeeper doesn't just block new deployments—it can also audit existing resources for policy violations.

### Enable Audit

Audit results are stored in the Constraint's `status` field:

kubectl get K8sRequiredResourceLimits require-deployment-limits -o yaml

text

Example output:

status:
auditTimestamp: "2025-10-15T10:30:00Z"
violations:
- enforcementAction: deny
kind: Deployment
message: "Container 'web' must define CPU limits"
name: legacy-app
namespace: production

text

This allows security teams to identify non-compliant resources without disrupting operations.

---

## Advanced OPA Use Cases

### 1. Enforcing Image Registry Restrictions

Prevent deployment of images from untrusted registries:

package k8sallowedrepos

violation[{"msg": msg}] {
container := input.review.object.spec.template.spec.containers[_]
not startswith(container.image, "gcr.io/my-company/")
msg := sprintf("Image '%s' is not from an approved registry", [container.image])
}

text

### 2. Requiring Labels for Cost Allocation

Enforce that all Deployments have a `cost-center` label:

package k8srequiredlabels

violation[{"msg": msg}] {
not input.review.object.metadata.labels["cost-center"]
msg := "All Deployments must have a 'cost-center' label"
}

text

### 3. Preventing Privileged Containers

Block containers running with `privileged: true`:

package k8spsprivileged

violation[{"msg": msg}] {
container := input.review.object.spec.template.spec.containers[_]
container.securityContext.privileged == true
msg := sprintf("Container '%s' cannot run in privileged mode", [container.name])
}

text

---

## Best Practices for OPA in Production

1. **Start with Audit Mode**: Use `enforcementAction: dryrun` to observe violations without blocking deployments
2. **Version Control Policies**: Store ConstraintTemplates and Constraints in Git for review and rollback
3. **Test Policies in Non-Production**: Validate new policies in dev/staging before applying to production
4. **Monitor Policy Performance**: OPA Gatekeeper exposes Prometheus metrics for policy evaluation latency
5. **Provide Clear Error Messages**: Developers should understand *why* their deployment was rejected and *how* to fix it

---

## Conclusion

Open Policy Agent transforms Kubernetes security from reactive to proactive. By codifying security requirements as Rego policies, you ensure that compliance is **automated**, **auditable**, and **enforced consistently** across all clusters.

Whether you're preventing resource exhaustion, enforcing image registry restrictions, or requiring security labels, OPA Gatekeeper provides a flexible, scalable solution for Policy-as-Code in Kubernetes.

**Security policies shouldn't be documents gathering dust—they should be code that actively protects your infrastructure.**
